Cycle is PHP DataMapper ORM and Data Modelling engine designed to safely work in classic and long-running PHP applications (like [RoadRunner](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner)). The ORM provides flexible configuration options to model datasets and support dynamic schema configuration. ORM can work with plain PHP objects and support annotation declarations.

Features:
---------
- ORM with has-one, has-many, many-thought-many and polymorphic relations
- embedded entities, lazy/eager loaded embedded partials
- Plain Old PHP Objects, ActiveRecord-like objects, [same object type for all entities](tests/ORM/Classless)
- same entity type for multiple repositories
- query builder with automatic relation resolution
- eager and lazy loading, proxies support, references support
- runtime configuration with/without code-generation
- column-to-field mapping, value objects support
- single table inheritance
- works with directed graphs and cyclic graphs using command chains
- designed to work in long-running applications, immutable service core, reconnects
- dirty state, sync exceptions do not break entity map state
- supports MySQL, MariaDB, PostgresSQL, SQLServer, SQLite
- schema scaffolding and migrations
- supports global query constrains, UUIDs as PK, soft deletes, auto timestamps
- supports custom persiters, disposable UoW, custom column types, FKs to non primary columns
- use with or without annotations, proxy classes and auto-migrations 
- compatible with Doctrine Collections and Zend Hydrator
